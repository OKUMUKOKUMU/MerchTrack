# Brown's MerchTrack

MerchTrack is a comprehensive, mobile-first **Retail Execution and Field Merchandising application**. It is designed to empower your entire field team—from merchandisers on the ground to directors in the head office—with the tools they need to track store visits, ensure compliance, monitor sales performance, and make data-driven decisions.

The application uses real-time data, mandatory photo proof, automatic GPS verification, and integrated AI—powered by the **Gemini API using Genkit (the evolution of the Firebase AI Logic SDKs)**—to provide a single source of truth for all field activities.

## How It Is Used: A Role-By-Role Guide
